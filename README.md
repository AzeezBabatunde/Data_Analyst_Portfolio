This repository is dedicated towards showcasing my data science and analytics skills using the basic analyzing tools such as Excel, SQL, Python and Power Bi

## Power Bi Projects
### 1. Youtube Song Analysis

#### Project Overview

Youtube is one of the best streaming platform where artist and song writers upload their songs for people to access and appreciate their talents while they gain popularity and money from channel monetization.
The goal of this analysis is to utilize Power BI to create insightful visualizations and reports that provide a deeper understanding of YouTube songs' performance, popularity, and user engagement.
In this analysis, I aim to uncover trends, preferences, and patterns in the data to aid content creators and stakeholders in optimizing their YouTube song content.

### 2. Income Statement Analysis

#### Project Overview

Income of every worker and business owners decides the extent at which they can prepare their lifestyles and bills attached to them.
The goal of this analysis is to utilize Power BI to create insightful visualizations and reports that provide a deeper understanding of how income is linked with expenses, tax, profit made and many more.
In this analysis, I aim to uncover trends, preferences, and patterns in the data to aid everyone involved in optimizing and planing their life through their income at different divisions and times of the year.

## SQL Projects
### 1. Hotel Reservation Analysis

#### Project Overview

The hotel industry relies on data analysis to make informed decisions and insight to provide a better guest experience. 
In this project, I worked with a hotel reservation dataset to gain insights into guest preferences, booking trends, and other key factors that impact the hotel's operations. 
I used SQL to query and analyze the data, as well as answer specific questions about the dataset.
